This is a simple script for creating coverage plots for *Seq data.

DEPENDENCIES:
-HTSeq
-numpy
-matplotlib
(e.g. you should be able to import any of these in your active session without error)

You can call it like:
python img_maker.py /path/to/bam/sample.bam /path/to/gtf_file.gtf ENST00000371222 2000 1000 pdf

Args are:
1.  path to a bam file (should be sorted and indexed, so make sure that a .bai file is also there.  Otherwise an exception is thrown)
2.  path to a GTF file.  Ensure that it has a transcript_id field
3.  a transcript ID.  This should be found in the 'transcript_id' attribute in the final field of the GTF line.  Since each gene has multiple
    transcripts, this allows you to specify which one you would like for the given gene.
4.  Left-buffer.  How many base pairs to the left of the transcript region you would like to plot
5.  Right-buffer.  How many base pairs to the right of the transcript region you would like to plot
6.  Output format.  png, pdf

Potential hangups include:
- a BAM file that is not sorted and indexed
- a BAM file that was created such that the chromosome names do not match with those in the GTF.  The script checks if
  the BAM and GTF files have the 'chr' prefix and handles the matching there.  However, for other types of differences
  in the naming scheme, you may have to play around with the chromosome names yourself, or edit the scripts.
